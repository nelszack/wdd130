        <p>This is my 2nd semester at BYUI and I am majoring in computer science.</p>            
        <p>I have been a member of the church my whole life. My favorite quote from one of the church leaders comes from President Nelson "Whatever questions or problems you have, the answer is always found in the life and teachings of Jesus Christ." </p>
        <p>My favorite scripture comes from Mosiah 4:9: "Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend"</p>
